Each of the 5 cheerleaders will receive $2,50 for each season they worked in the two-year period covered by the suit. The final amount will include interest and will depend on how many football seasons they worked. If a cheerleader participated in photo shoots, she could receive up to $40 per shoot.

From Jan. 1 to Aug. 3, 2016, the CDC reported 50 people in 4 U.S. states had been diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), compared with only 2 people in 2015 in 16 U.S. states. From August to December 2014, 12 people, mostly children 1 and younger, in 4 U.S. states, were diagnosed with the condition. AFM affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, according to the CDC. The cause is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Enteroviruses can cause neurologic illness such as meningitis, but more serious disease like encephalitis and AFM are less common. Symptoms of AFM include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and severely, respiratory failure that occur when muscles involved in breathing become weak. The latter symptom can require urgent ventilator support, according to the CDC. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but rather neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. Although the AFM outbreak in 2014 coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68, the CDC did not detect the severe respiratory virus in the AFM specimens collected that year. Among the people with AFM in 2015, the CDC also did not detect the virus in the specimens collected, and limited sporadic cases of the virus have been detected in the United States in 2016. As health officials investigate the current rise of AFM cases, they are advising people to wash their hands with soap and water, avoid close contact with sick people, and clean surfaces with a disinfectant, especially those that a sick person has touched.\n\n\n\nBreaking News:\n\n\n\nGet breaking", "answers": ["At first, it seemed like 4-year-old Laura Carson was suffering from a simple headache.

The investigation into the bloodstain pattern on the cloth was reported Tuesday in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and is apparently the first such analysis of the controversial shroud. Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud shows the image of a crucified man and has been analyzed and scrutinized for many, many years. The Vatican regards it as an icon, rather than a religious relic—and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. In 2015, more than 2 million people saw the Shroud, which is 14-feet-long, 3.5-feet-wide and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case. The cloth has long been the subject of debate and study. Researchers concluded that the linen seems to be patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, reports BuzzFeed News, adding evidence to claims that it is a fraud. Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, told BuzzFeed News that “Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.” Borrini and his colleagues used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. By pumping blood onto a model at wound shown on the shroud, researchers could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction depicted on the linen.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

{"pred": "\n\n\nThe news article is about Wendy Davis, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate from Texas, who became a political sensation by filibustering her state's tough new restrictions on abortion. She discloses in her upcoming memoir that she had an abortion in the 19990s after discovering the fetus had a severe brain abnormality. The abortion happened before she became a state senator from Fort Worth and began her political career. She catapulted to national stardom after her filibuster temporarily delayed new abortion restrictions. She is now running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Rick Perry next year. The second abortion happened in 19969 during her second trimester. She took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn't warrant concern. But a later exam revealed the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides. She sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery. She felt her little body tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and knew what she needed to do. She was suffering. An indescribable blackness followed the abortion and the loss left her forever changed. The ectopic pregnancy happened in 1949 and terminating it was considered medically necessary. Such pregnancies aren't considered viable, meaning the fetus can't survive, and they can endanger the mother's life. But Davis writes that in Texas, it's \"technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such.\" She filibustered in June 2013, setting off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight. Thousands of people watched it online, with President Obama tweeting \"Something special is happening in Austin tonight.\" She recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

The investigator, Felix Wade, told Peruvians last month that four suspects had been arrested by police who confessed to murdering up to 60 people. He said they were selling their fat for thousands of dollars a liter. But the macabre tale now appears to be nothing more than a tall story or a big lie. In an extraordinary press conference, police showed two bottles of what they said was human fat and a photo of a decapitated head. Wade told journalists how four suspects had confessed to gruesome murders reviving an Andean legend about the Pishtac - mythical killers who murdered people on lonely roads to collect their fat. But two weeks later a complete lack of evidence showed the police account to be more fiction that fact. As a result, Peru's chief of police, Miguel Hidalgo, announced Wade would be indefinite leave from his job for sullying the reputation of his unit. Initial doubts were compounded when police from the region where the crimes were alleged to have taken place said they knew nothing about a gang of murderers killing people for their fat. They were only able to corroborate one of the dozens of disappearances in a region where drug-trafficking and violence is rife. Wade and the head of the anti-kidnapping unit had also claimed the fat was sold for thousands of dollars in the European black market, but could not confirm any sales. Medical experts dismissed this theory, saying human fat had no monetary value and injecting it from one person to another would be potentially life-threatening.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The government response in Libya underlined an unintended consequence of uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, where protests pouring into the streets after day forced the departure of long-serving authoritarian leaders. In Libya, Yemen and Algeria, the governments have quickly resorted to violence before it gathers momentum that might threaten their grip on power. Advertisement Continue the main story. A day of antigovernment marches in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, took a violent turn as government supporters opened fire on a group opposing 3-year rule of President Abdullah Saleh, wounding at least four people. And hundreds of police in Algerian capital, Algiers, used clubs to overwhelm antigovernment demonstrators. The crackdown in Libya has proven the bloodiest of the recent actions, drawing criticism from the United States and European allies. In London, Foreign Minister William Hague said he had reports that heavy weapons were used against protests, organized in a half-dozen cities or more. This is clearly unacceptable and horrifying, he said in a statement. Earlier in the day, thousands had returned to the courthouse in Benghazi. Idris al-Agha, a Libyan writer by telephone, said the crowd had grown to more than 2000 by midday - confirmed by others - with many of them planning to take part in funeral marches dozens of people killed a day before. Opposition Web sites reported that security forces later fired on some of the mourners. One site, Manara, said snipers fired from an army base that sits on the route to the cemetery, and a video posted on a Facebook page that has compiled images from the protests showed a march under fire, with at least one shot in the head.
